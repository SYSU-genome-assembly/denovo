Hu :
##the routine
We are in a **Mathematical** model contest instead of cpp contest, which means we should be foucsing more on the math. We should be comparing algorithms and analysing overall time complexity and try to modifiy a piece at a time, rather than rewriting the whole thing. That's how, in my opinion, we should make progress. Time is running short after all.

I 'll try to list things that need to be done here.
###plausible steps to be taken
  *TODO: More discussion is needed here. But we already know only the  **O** in OLC is a problem.
###paper structure
Over the week, we've read many a paper which share the same structure as follows (Words in **Boldface** is TODO.):
  * Abstract
  * Background (random order)
    1. Intro to the problem
    2. OLC
    3. De Bruijn graph
    4. Greedy graph
  * __Methods__
    * __Steps aforementioned__
  * __Results__(comparison included)
  * __Discussion and conclusion__
  * Availability
  * __Additional file__
  * __References__
